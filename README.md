# cf-owntracks

cf-owntracks is a location tracking server implementation based on Cloudflare Workers, inspired by the [OwnTracks](https://owntracks.org/) project. Compared to the original OwnTracks which requires self-hosting a server, this project leverages the advantages of Cloudflare Workers to provide a low-cost, easy-to-deploy, highly available, and high-performance alternative.

## Features

- üöÄ Based on Cloudflare Workers, no need to self-host a server
- üíæ Uses R2 to store location data, low cost
- üîí Built-in Basic Auth protection
- ‚ö° Distributed via global edge network, low latency
- üì± Fully compatible with OwnTracks client
- üîç Supports historical location queries
- üìç Supports real-time location updates

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Cloudflare account
